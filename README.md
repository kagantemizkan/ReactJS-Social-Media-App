# Social Media Web App

We initiated this project with Yigit Taskin and started with the design phase by using Figma. After that, we utilized various technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React.JS to develop the front-end of the project.

Furthermore, we are planning to implement the back-end using PHP and MySQL to improve the functionality of the project.

Additionally, you can also find this project in [Yigit's GitHub](https://github.com/yigittaskin/ReactJS-Social-Media-App) profile.
